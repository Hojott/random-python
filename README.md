# Random Python

Random Python code made for different things, quality by no means guaranteed.

Note this repo might contain code also present in other repos, because I usually first add my code here when making smaller projects.

## Cryptography
Cryptography course, because the website didn't really work.
For a well implemented algorithm check hojott/vigenere

## Math
Code about math, usually inspired by YT-videos

## Minecraft
Some code for skimming through Minecraft source files

## Completely random
I'm not even sure about these...
